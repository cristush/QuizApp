# QuizApp
Project #3 for Udacity - Google Developer Challange Scholarship - Android Basics

The app is a quiz with 10 questions related to Romania.
There are questions with a single possible answer, some with multiple possible answers and some with EditText box for writing text answers.

When submitting the quiz, the app highlights the correct answers in green and the wrong answers in red.
It also displays a toast message with the number of correct answers and tells the user if the test was passed or not (minimum 6 correct answers).

Please feel free to suggest improvements to the code and/or the design. Thank you !
